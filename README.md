#Trying on frontend

Simple copy of Zerodha landing page
- HTML
- CSS


what ive learned is- html is minimal in use during building a web page. it onlt offers a structre to the web page and a lot of is handled by css and JS. in this project ive mainly used html and css properties to style the page.
learnings-
CSS - display flex is a modern way of positioning a div and just like display flex we have display block which unlike flex takes the entire row.
